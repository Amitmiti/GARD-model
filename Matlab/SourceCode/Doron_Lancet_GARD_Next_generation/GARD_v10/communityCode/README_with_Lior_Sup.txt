DESCRIPTION
-----------
Beta_louvain.m; receives a random-seed (integer number) and generates a
lognormal beta network using GARD10, than Louvainâ€™s MATLAB function
cluster_jl_orient is run. Output out.indices is an array holding for each
molecule the index of the community it belongs to.

Beta_infomap.m: receives a random-seed (integer number) and generates a
lognormal beta network using GARD10, than saves the b to disk and run Infomap
as an externally program (UNIX or Windows). Output out.indices is an array
holding for each molecule the index of the community it belongs to.

Beta_oslom.m: similar to Beta_infomap.m, running program oslom_dir. Ouput
out.indices is an array of MATLAB cells, holding for each molecule a list of
indices of communities it belongs to.

getmaxrealevec.m receives a beta (or b_pseudo) and return as its first output
the eigenvector with the highest real eigenvalue.


RUN
---
It is assumed that MATLAB is already installed and running, and that GARD10 has
been extracted and that the path to GARD10 is already added to MATLAB.

Usage example: out=Beta_louvain(45); out.indices(:);

Usage example: b=tgs_newbeta_v10(45); [evec, eval]=getmaxrealevec(b); eval, plot(evec);
